# Portfolio Optimization Examples Using Financial Toolbox

This Streamlit application demonstrates portfolio optimization concepts using a synthetic dataset similar to the MATLAB Financial Toolbox examples. It allows users to interactively explore efficient frontiers, Sharpe ratio maximization, and the impact of constraints.

## Instructions

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3.  Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4.  Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Run the application: `streamlit run app.py`

## Security Considerations

The application uses synthetic data and does not handle any sensitive information. However, the following security aspects should be considered:

*   **Input Validation:**  User inputs should be validated to prevent potential issues such as code injection.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Regularly update dependencies to address any security vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code for any potential security flaws.

## Notes

The application utilizes Plotly for visualizations.
