# QuLab User Guide

This codelab provides a comprehensive guide to using the QuLab application. QuLab is designed as a multi-page application built with Streamlit, offering a modular structure for showcasing different functionalities or concepts. Understanding the navigation and structure of QuLab will allow you to effectively explore and utilize its features. This guide will walk you through the application's layout and demonstrate how to interact with its various pages.

## Understanding the QuLab Layout
Duration: 00:02

QuLab is structured with a sidebar for navigation and a main area for content display. This separation allows for easy switching between different sections of the application. The sidebar contains the navigation menu, while the main area displays the content associated with the selected page.

## Navigating Through QuLab
Duration: 00:03

1.  **Sidebar Navigation:** Locate the sidebar on the left side of the application. You'll find the QuantUniversity logo and a navigation menu labeled "Navigation".
2.  **Selecting a Page:** The "Navigation" menu is a dropdown selectbox. Click on it to reveal a list of available pages: "Page 1", "Page 2", and "Page 3".
3.  **Switching Pages:** Select a page from the dropdown menu. The main area of the application will update to display the content associated with the selected page.

## Exploring Page 1
Duration: 00:01

1.  **Selecting Page 1:** In the sidebar's "Navigation" menu, choose "Page 1".
2.  **Page 1 Content:** The main area will now display "Page 1" as a title, followed by the text "Content for Page 1". This is a placeholder, and in a real application, this space would contain interactive elements, visualizations, or other relevant information.

## Exploring Page 2
Duration: 00:01

1.  **Selecting Page 2:** In the sidebar's "Navigation" menu, choose "Page 2".
2.  **Page 2 Content:** The main area will now display "Page 2" as a title, followed by the text "Content for Page 2". Similar to Page 1, this is a placeholder for actual content.

## Exploring Page 3
Duration: 00:01

1.  **Selecting Page 3:** In the sidebar's "Navigation" menu, choose "Page 3".
2.  **Page 3 Content:** The main area will now display "Page 3" as a title, followed by the text "Content for Page 3". This is another placeholder page.

## Understanding the Footer

At the bottom of the main area, you'll find a footer. This footer contains:

1.  **Copyright Information:**  "Â© 2025 QuantUniversity. All Rights Reserved." indicates the copyright holder and reservation of rights.
2.  **Disclaimer:** A caption states that the demonstration is for educational purposes only and requires written consent for reproduction. This highlights the application's purpose and any usage restrictions.
