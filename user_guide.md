# QuLab: A Guide to Portfolio Optimization

This codelab provides a hands-on guide to using QuLab, a Streamlit application designed to illustrate key concepts in portfolio optimization. Understanding asset risks and returns, constructing efficient frontiers, and applying various constraints are crucial for effective portfolio management. This application offers a visual and interactive way to explore these concepts.  We will explore different portfolio construction scenarios, understand the impact of constraints, and visualize the efficient frontier.

## Navigating QuLab

Duration: 00:01

QuLab is structured with a sidebar for easy navigation. The sidebar contains the navigation menu, which allows you to jump to different portfolio optimization scenarios.  Each scenario is presented as a separate page within the application.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Tip:</b> The sidebar is your central control panel. Use it to explore the different facets of portfolio optimization.

## Asset Risks and Returns

Duration: 00:03

This page visualizes the risk-return profile of individual assets, along with the market portfolio, a cash position, and an equally weighted portfolio.  The plot displays the annualized mean return on the y-axis and the annualized risk (standard deviation) on the x-axis.

1.  Select "Asset Risks and Returns" from the navigation menu.
2.  Observe the scatter plot displaying the risk and return of individual assets. Note the positions of "Market", "Cash" and "Equal" portfolios relative to the individual assets.

This visualization helps understand the risk-return trade-offs of different assets and provides a benchmark for evaluating portfolio performance.

## Efficient Frontier

Duration: 00:05

The efficient frontier represents a set of portfolios that offer the highest possible expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest possible risk for a given level of expected return. This page demonstrates the concept of the efficient frontier.

1.  Select "Efficient Frontier" from the navigation menu.
2.  Examine the plotted efficient frontier, which is shown as a blue line. The markers show the "Market", "Cash" and "Equal" portfolios.

The efficient frontier is a core concept in modern portfolio theory, providing a benchmark for optimal portfolio construction. Portfolios that lie on the efficient frontier are considered to be optimally diversified.

## Efficient Frontier with Tangent Line

Duration: 00:05

The tangent line represents the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) with the steepest slope, indicating the portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio.  This page extends the efficient frontier visualization by adding a tangent line, illustrating the portfolio with the best risk-adjusted return.

1.  Select "Efficient Frontier with Tangent Line" from the navigation menu.
2.  Observe the efficient frontier with the added tangent line. This line touches the efficient frontier at the point representing the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe Ratio.

The tangent portfolio, also known as the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio, is the optimal portfolio to combine with a risk-free asset.

## Range of Risks and Returns

Duration: 00:03

This page demonstrates the minimum and maximum possible risk and return that can be achieved from the assets.

1.  Select "Range of Risks and Returns" from the navigation menu.
2.  Observe the maximum and minimum risk and return values displayed.

This helps in understanding the extreme boundaries of possible portfolio outcomes.

## Efficient Frontier with Targeted Portfolios

Duration: 00:07

This page lets you set the target risk and target return, and visualizes the efficient frontier along with portfolios that meet the risk or return target.

1. Select "Efficient Frontier with Targeted Portfolios" from the navigation menu.
2. Use the number input fields to specify your desired "Target Return (Annualized)" and "Target Risk (Annualized)".
3. Observe the changes in the location of the target return and target risk portfolios on the efficient frontier.

<aside class="negative">
Keep in mind that the application generates random portfolios. The target risk and target return are based on randomly generated weights, so there is a high chance that the risk/return target is not actually met.
</aside>

## Transaction Costs

Duration: 00:07

This page explores the impact of transaction costs on the efficient frontier.

1.  Select "Transactions Costs" from the navigation menu.
2.  Use the number input fields to specify the "Buy Cost" and "Sell Cost" as a decimal (for example, 0.001 for 0.1%).
3.  Observe the change in the efficient frontier due to transaction costs.  The "Net" line shows the efficient frontier after accounting for these costs.

Transaction costs reduce the net return of a portfolio and shift the efficient frontier inwards.  Higher transaction costs lead to a more significant shift.

## Turnover Constraint

Duration: 00:05

This page demonstrates the effect of a turnover constraint on the efficient frontier. Turnover is a measure of how frequently assets are bought and sold in a portfolio.

1.  Select "Turnover Constraint" from the navigation menu.
2.  Use the number input field to specify the "Turnover Rate (Max)" as a decimal.
3.  Observe the change in the efficient frontier after setting the turnover constraint. The constraint restricts how much the portfolio composition can change over a period of time.

## Tracking-Error Constraint

Duration: 00:05

This page examines the impact of a tracking-error constraint, which limits how much a portfolio's return can deviate from a benchmark.

1.  Select "Tracking-Error Constraint" from the navigation menu.
2.  Observe the efficient frontier with the tracking-error constraint applied.

The tracking-error constraint ensures that the portfolio closely follows the performance of the chosen benchmark.

## Combined Turnover and Tracking-Error Constraints

Duration: 00:07

This page combines both turnover and tracking-error constraints to create a more realistic portfolio optimization scenario.

1.  Select "Combined Turnover and Tracking-Error Constraints" from the navigation menu.
2.  Use the number input field to specify the "Turnover Rate (Max)" as a decimal.
3.  Observe the efficient frontier under the combined constraints.

Combining constraints provides a more practical approach to portfolio optimization, balancing the desire for high returns with the need for controlled trading activity and benchmark adherence.

## Maximize the Sharpe Ratio

Duration: 00:05

This page focuses on finding the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe Ratio, which represents the best risk-adjusted return.

1.  Select "Maximize the Sharpe Ratio" from the navigation menu.
2.  Observe the efficient frontier, with the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio marked as "Sharpe".

The Sharpe Ratio is a widely used metric for evaluating portfolio performance, and maximizing it is a common objective in portfolio optimization.

## Confirm that Maximum Sharpe Ratio is a Maximum

Duration: 00:07

This page provides visual confirmation that the Sharpe Ratio is indeed maximized at the identified portfolio.

1. Select "Confirm that Maximum Sharpe Ratio is a Maximum" from the navigation menu.
2. Observe the efficient frontier and Sharpe Ratio plots. The second plot visualizes the Sharpe ratio for the efficient frontier and the maximum Sharpe portfolio.

This visualization reinforces the concept that the Sharpe Ratio represents an optimal point on the risk-return spectrum.

## Illustrate that Sharpe is the Tangent Portfolio

Duration: 00:05

This page visually demonstrates that the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio is also the tangent portfolio on the efficient frontier.

1.  Select "Illustrate that Sharpe is the Tangent Portfolio" from the navigation menu.
2.  Observe the efficient frontier and tangent portfolio. The tangent portfolio marks the maximum Sharpe ratio.

## Dollar-Neutral Hedge-Fund Structure

Duration: 00:07

This page explores portfolio construction under a dollar-neutral constraint, commonly used in hedge funds.

1.  Select "Dollar-Neutral Hedge-Fund Structure" from the navigation menu.
2.  Use the number input field to specify the "Exposure" level.
3.  Observe the efficient frontier under the dollar-neutral constraint.  Dollar-neutral portfolios have equal long and short positions, aiming to be market-neutral.

This type of strategy seeks to profit from relative price movements rather than overall market direction.
