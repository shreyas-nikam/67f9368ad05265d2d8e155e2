# QuLab: A Deep Dive into Portfolio Optimization with Streamlit

This codelab provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing the QuLab application, a Streamlit-based tool designed for exploring various portfolio optimization techniques. QuLab offers a user-friendly interface to analyze and construct portfolios based on different objectives and constraints. This application is crucial for finance professionals, students, and anyone interested in quantitative finance and portfolio management. By the end of this codelab, you will understand the application's architecture, its functionalities, and how to extend it for your specific needs.

## Setting Up the Environment
Duration: 00:05

Before diving into the application, ensure you have the necessary environment set up. You'll need Python installed, along with the Streamlit library.

1.  **Install Streamlit:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```console
pip install streamlit
```

2.  **Clone the Project:**  Create a new directory for this project and save the provided python files inside it.

## Exploring the Application Structure
Duration: 00:10

Let's examine the structure of the QuLab application. The project is organized into two main parts:

*   `app.py`: This is the main entry point of the Streamlit application. It handles the overall layout, navigation, and routing of different portfolio optimization pages.
*   `application_pages/`: This directory contains individual Python files, each representing a specific portfolio optimization technique or constraint.  For example, `efficient_frontier.py`, `targeted_portfolios.py`, etc.

This modular structure makes it easy to add new functionalities and maintain the existing codebase.

## Understanding the Main Application (app.py)
Duration: 00:15

The `app.py` file is the heart of the QuLab application. Let's break down its key components:

1.  **Import Statements:**
    ```python
    import streamlit as st
    ```
    This line imports the Streamlit library, which is essential for creating the web application.

2.  **Page Configuration:**
    ```python
    st.set_page_config(page_title="QuLab", layout="wide")
    ```
    This configures the Streamlit page settings, setting the title to "QuLab" and using a wide layout for better screen utilization.

3.  **Sidebar Elements:**
    ```python
    st.sidebar.image("https://www.quantuniversity.com/assets/img/logo5.jpg")
    st.sidebar.divider()
    st.title("QuLab")
    st.divider()
    ```
    These lines add elements to the sidebar, including the QuantUniversity logo, dividers, and the main title of the application.

4.  **Navigation:**
    ```python
    page = st.sidebar.selectbox(label="Navigation", options=["Efficient Frontier", "Targeted Portfolios", "Transaction Costs", "Turnover Constraint", "Tracking-Error Constraint", "Combined Constraints", "Maximize Sharpe Ratio", "Confirm Sharpe Ratio", "Tangent Portfolio", "Dollar-Neutral Hedge-Fund"])
    ```
    This creates a selectbox in the sidebar, allowing users to navigate between different portfolio optimization pages. The `options` list defines the available pages.

5.  **Page Routing:**
    ```python
    if page == "Efficient Frontier":
        from application_pages.efficient_frontier import run_efficient_frontier
        run_efficient_frontier()
    # ... (similar blocks for other pages)
    ```
    This section uses a series of `if/elif` statements to determine which page to display based on the user's selection in the navigation selectbox. It dynamically imports the corresponding function from the `application_pages` directory and executes it.

6.  **Footer:**
    ```python
    st.divider()
    st.write("Â© 2025 QuantUniversity. All Rights Reserved.")
    st.caption("The purpose of this demonstration is solely for educational use and illustration. "
               "Any reproduction of this demonstration "
               "requires prior written consent from QuantUniversity.")
    ```
    This adds a footer to the application with copyright information and a disclaimer.

## Examining Individual Application Pages (application_pages/)
Duration: 00:15

Each file in the `application_pages/` directory represents a specific portfolio optimization technique. Let's look at `efficient_frontier.py` as an example:

```python
import streamlit as st

def run_efficient_frontier():
    st.header("Efficient Frontier")
    st.write("This is the efficient frontier page.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_efficient_frontier()
```

*   **Import Statement:**  It starts by importing the `streamlit` library.
*   **`run_efficient_frontier()` Function:**  This function contains the logic for displaying the efficient frontier page. Currently, it only displays a header and a simple text message.  This is where the core functionality for calculating and visualizing the efficient frontier would reside.
*   **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block:**  This block ensures that the `run_efficient_frontier()` function is called only when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).

The other files in the `application_pages/` directory (`targeted_portfolios.py`, `transaction_costs.py`, etc.) follow a similar structure.  They currently contain placeholders, and you'll need to implement the specific portfolio optimization logic for each page.

## Running the Application
Duration: 00:05

To run the QuLab application, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `app.py`, and run the following command:

```console
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your web browser. You should see the QuLab application with the sidebar navigation.  Clicking on different options in the selectbox will display the corresponding page (currently showing placeholder content).

## Extending the Application: Implementing Efficient Frontier
Duration: 01:00

Now, let's extend the application by implementing the efficient frontier functionality. This will involve:

1.  **Data Input:**  Add a section to `efficient_frontier.py` to allow users to upload or input asset data (e.g., historical returns, covariance matrix).  You can use Streamlit widgets like `st.file_uploader` or `st.text_input`.

2.  **Optimization Logic:** Implement the mathematical optimization algorithm to calculate the efficient frontier. This typically involves minimizing portfolio variance for a given level of expected return or maximizing Sharpe ratio.  You might use libraries like `NumPy`, `SciPy`, or `cvxopt` for this.

3.  **Visualization:** Use Streamlit's charting capabilities (e.g., `st.line_chart`, `st.pyplot`) to visualize the efficient frontier. The x-axis should represent portfolio risk (e.g., standard deviation), and the y-axis should represent portfolio return.

Here's a basic example of how you might start implementing the efficient frontier page. This example requires you to install `numpy` and `matplotlib`: `pip install numpy matplotlib`

```python
# application_pages/efficient_frontier.py

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def run_efficient_frontier():
    st.header("Efficient Frontier")

    # Sample Data (Replace with actual data input)
    mean_returns = np.array([0.10, 0.15, 0.20])  # Example mean returns for 3 assets
    cov_matrix = np.array([[0.01, 0.005, 0.002],
                           [0.005, 0.0225, 0.003],
                           [0.002, 0.003, 0.04]]) # Example covariance matrix

    # Number of portfolios to generate
    num_portfolios = 100

    # Generate random portfolio weights
    results = np.zeros((3,num_portfolios))
    for i in range(num_portfolios):
        weights = np.random.random(3)
        weights /= np.sum(weights)  # Normalize weights to sum to 1

        # Calculate portfolio return and standard deviation
        portfolio_return = np.sum(mean_returns * weights)
        portfolio_std_dev = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights)))

        results[0,i] = portfolio_return
        results[1,i] = portfolio_std_dev
        results[2,i] = weights

    # Create the efficient frontier plot
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.scatter(results[1,:], results[0,:], c=results[0,:], cmap='viridis') # Color by return
    ax.set_xlabel('Volatility (Standard Deviation)')
    ax.set_ylabel('Expected Return')
    ax.set_title('Efficient Frontier')

    st.pyplot(fig)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_efficient_frontier()
```

This is a simplified example.  A real-world implementation would involve more sophisticated optimization techniques, handling missing data, and allowing users to customize optimization parameters.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Tip:</b> Break down the implementation into smaller, manageable steps. Start with basic data input and visualization, then gradually add complexity to the optimization logic.
</aside>

## Implementing Other Portfolio Optimization Techniques
Duration: 01:30

You can follow a similar approach to implement the other portfolio optimization techniques in the `application_pages/` directory:

*   **Targeted Portfolios:** Implement functionality to allow users to specify target return and risk levels and find portfolios that meet those targets.
*   **Transaction Costs:** Incorporate transaction costs into the optimization process.  This requires modeling the impact of trading on portfolio returns.
*   **Turnover Constraint:**  Implement a constraint on portfolio turnover, limiting the amount of trading that can occur.
*   **Tracking-Error Constraint:** Minimize the tracking error of a portfolio relative to a benchmark index.
*   **Combined Constraints:** Allow users to combine multiple constraints (e.g., turnover constraint, tracking-error constraint) in the optimization process.
*   **Maximize Sharpe Ratio:**  Implement an optimization algorithm to directly maximize the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio.
*   **Confirm Sharpe Ratio:** Functionality to validate calculated Sharpe ratios.
*   **Tangent Portfolio:** Find the tangent portfolio on the efficient frontier, which represents the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.
*   **Dollar-Neutral Hedge Fund:** Implement a strategy for constructing a dollar-neutral hedge fund portfolio.

For each technique, you'll need to:

1.  Design the user interface using Streamlit widgets.
2.  Implement the core optimization logic using appropriate mathematical techniques and libraries.
3.  Visualize the results using Streamlit's charting capabilities.

<aside class="negative">
<b>Warning:</b> Portfolio optimization can be computationally intensive, especially with large datasets and complex constraints.  Consider using efficient algorithms and data structures to optimize performance.
</aside>
